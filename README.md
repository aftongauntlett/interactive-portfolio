An interactive portfolio focused on game-inspired UI/UX, narrative framing, and playful presentation.

## Key Features

- **Interactive, Game-Inspired UI** — A portfolio presented as an experience (tone, pacing, and “world” building)
- **Narrative-Driven Flow** — Clear entry points and progression that guide visitors through content
- **Motion & Feedback** — UI states designed for responsiveness and delight (without sacrificing readability)
- **UI/UX Craft** — Layout, hierarchy, and micro-interactions optimized for scanning and comprehension
- **TypeScript-First Codebase** — Strict typing to keep UI state and content handling predictable

## Tech Stack

- React 19
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Vite (dev server + build)
- CSS (via [src/index.css](src/index.css))

## Project Structure

Clean separation of concerns with reusable components, custom hooks, and utility functions:
