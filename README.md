# The Stanley Parable Portfolio Experience

An interactive portfolio that transforms code exploration into a narrative adventure. Built with React 19 and TypeScript, inspired by The Stanley Parable's signature wit.

**Tech Stack:** React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Zustand, Framer Motion

## Features

- **Interactive Terminal** — Custom git command parser with syntax highlighting and breakout animation
- **Adaptive Narrator System** — Real-time commentary using typing effects and idle timers
- **State Orchestration** — Complex phase management (idle → phone → monitor → settings → complete)
- **Diegetic UI** — All interactions (phone, monitor, settings) integrated into story world

## Technical Demonstration

- Complex state management across multiple interactive systems  
- TypeScript type safety and component composition  
- Custom hooks for timing, responsive behavior, and narrator logic  
- Performance optimization with error boundaries  
- Clean code architecture (components/hooks/state/content separation)  
- Accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen readers, reduced motion)
